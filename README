== INTRODUCTION ==
CafePressAPI is a simple Ruby wrapper for some of the CafePress API
http://developer.cafepress.com/docs

== HOW TO ==
The library is fairly simple. Taking a look at the class methods defined in
cafepress_api.rb will give you a better idea of how things work. Configuration
stuff can either be passed as argument(s) when calling the methods, or placed
in environment variables.

$ irb
> require 'rubygems'
=> true
> require 'cafepress_api'
=> true
> CafePressAPI.get_store_products('carabinerpirate','YOUR-CAFEPRESS-API-KEY')
=> [{:cafepress_design_id=>"21823412", :cafepress_back_design_id=>nil, :default_caption=>"Women's Long Sleeve Dark T-Shirt", :cafepress_product_id=>"164539429", :name=>"Pirates of the Carabiner Women's Long Sleeve Shirt", :url=>"http://www.cafepress.com/buy/x/-/pv_design_prod/pg_1/p_2627625.164539429/pNo_164539429"}, ...]

I wrote this gem for a Rails app which creates a portal of multiple CafePress
basic stores (https://github.com/benjaminleesmith/cafepress_wrapper). This gem
was built with very specific use cases in mind. If you find it lacking, please
improve on it and contribute (https://github.com/benjaminleesmith/cafepress_api)

== TODO ==
* Lots.
